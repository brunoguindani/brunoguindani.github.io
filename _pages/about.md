I am a post-doc researcher at Politecnico di Milano, in the Software Engineering Group ([DeepSE](https://www.deepse.deib.polimi.it)).
I pursue research on statistical-based formal validation methods for digital twin software architectures.

I earned my Ph.D. degree in Information Technology in 2024, conducting research on statistical approaches for managing resources of cloud, edge, and high-performance computing systems.
In 2021, I earned my M.Sc. degree in Mathematical Engineering - Applied Statistics.

Alternatively, you can usually find me in my office.
